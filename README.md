# Directory structure


| directory/file | explanation |
|-----------------------|------|
| /post/                | Where to put your MDX articles |
| /src/                 | Where to mainly edit source code |
| /public/              | The location where the built code is output when gatsby builds. Publish this content when publishing the site |
| /gatsby-config.js     | Used when adding gatsby plugins. You can run the plugin by writing here. |


## /src/ directory description


| directory/file | explanation |
|-----------------------|------|
| /component/           | Directory to place React components |
| /hooks/               | Directory for placing SEO-related components |
| /image/               | A directory where images such as icons and profile images commonly used within the site are placed. |
| /static/              | Where to place files such as favicon and files that you do not want to be processed by webpack |
| /tamplate/            | A special directory for Gatsby. It receives a dynamically created page with gatsby-node.js and outputs the page according to the instructions in the files in this directory. |
| /style/               | Directory where CSS and Tailwind CSS related files are placed. Since tailwindcss is overwritten with global.css, normal CSS written in global.css will be applied. However, it is not recommended for tailwindcss, so it is better not to use it too often. It is recommended to use tailwindcss for styling. |

If the page does not display well, the cache may be at fault, so try using the gatsby clean command.
