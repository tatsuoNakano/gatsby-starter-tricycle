# My First Experience with Tailwind CSS: Exploring the World of Utility-First Styling
In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, the quest for efficient and flexible styling methods remains a constant pursuit. Recently, I embarked on a journey to explore Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework known for its pragmatic approach to front-end design.
As I delved into the world of Tailwind CSS, I was immediately struck by its unique methodology. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that rely on pre-defined classes and component libraries, Tailwind CSS champions the concept of utility-first styling. This approach empowers developers to craft user interfaces by directly applying utility classes that define specific styling properties.

## Diving into Tailwind CSS: My First Encounter with Utility-First Styling
The first step in my journey involved familiarizing myself with Tailwind CSS's extensive utility class library. From typography and spacing to flexbox and grid layouts, Tailwind CSS provides a comprehensive set of utilities that cover virtually every aspect of front-end styling. As I perused through the documentation, I was impressed by the framework's granularity and precision in defining styling attributes.

When the reset CSS of Tailwind CSS removes all default CSS effects,you can apply common styles across your site by using global.css where you can write regular CSS.
However, it's not encouraged to use it extensively as it goes against the philosophy of Tailwind CSS.
